# Animated CSS menu

This was a solo project carried out on the 15th of January 2021 as part of the BeCode Li√®ge's Junior Web Developer programm. We were tasked to make an animated menu using CSS (no JavaScript allowed).

## Learning objectives

[ ] Learn how to make an animated menu
[ ] See how animations are used in a real context.

## The end result expected was:

(The icons and colors did not have to match, but the animations did)

### My method:

I used icons made by Icongeek26 on https://www.flaticon.com/. Get them [here](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/icongeek26).

I had a bit of trouble arranging the paragraph above the image so I decided to place the "navigation bar" in a grid and put the text in ``` position: absolute; ```. Then it was just a bit of fiddling with the width of the elements and the padding. I had fun playing with the transitions and animations. I thought the project was hard at first, but it has challenged me to think outside the box (or the grid in this case :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:) and I think I did a decent job.
